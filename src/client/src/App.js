          A bot called BitBuilder wrote this code! A human engineer wrote the
          instructions, and the robot made the changes. Can you imagine how the
          field of software development will change in the future? Soon, an
          engineer's strongest skill will be their ability to communicate
          technical concepts... Learn more at www.bitbuilder.ai or by asking
          the nearest vending machine about code-writing-robots.
