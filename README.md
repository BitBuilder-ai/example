## Tips and suggestions
1. We encourage you to build your application Bit by Bit.  Assign small, clearly written tasks to BitBuilder.  See the examples. 
2.  Include markdown formatted links to other files that are relevant to the implementation.  See [this](https://github.com/Tectonic-Labs/example/issues/1) example.
3.  For complex features, the implementations raised by BitBuilder are often imperfect, but they serve as a useful starting point.
